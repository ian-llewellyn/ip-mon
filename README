ip-mon

Author: Ian Llewellyn

IP-Mon is a very simple and quite useful visual monitor of servers. It reads a
configuration file called .ip-mon located in your home directory for the list
of servers and any comments/groupings. The program outputs groups/comments in
blue, alive servers in green and failed servers in red making it immediately
apparent when there is a problem.
