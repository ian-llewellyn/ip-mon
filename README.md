# ip-mon
**Author:** Ian Llewellyn

**ip-mon** is a very simple and useful visual monitor of network nodes. It
reads a configuration file called `.ip-mon` located in your home directory for
the list of nodes and any comments/groupings that should be displayed. The
program outputs groups/comments in blue, alive nodes in green and failed nodes
in red making it immediately apparent when there is a problem. All colours can
be customised in `.ip-monrc`.
